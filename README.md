A EtchASketch in your browser made entirely of code! 

This is another project given by the Odin Project course and is said to be a little more difficult than the others mainly because it goes a little deeper into sections of code that require research and trial/error. 

This will be another project basically showing what i have learned so far but also a another way to learn certain code methods and to improve at the logic. 

Anyways.. Take a look at it and give it a shot! 
Let me know what you think of it and give some advice on what could be fixed etc. 
It will be appreciated..

Alright, Enjoy!
